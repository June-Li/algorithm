## [0.5.3] — 2017-02-27
### Fixed
- Allow `import pdfplumber` even if ImageMagick not installed.

## [0.5.2] — 2017-02-27
### Added
- Access to `curve` points. (E.g., `page.curves[0]["points"]`.)
- Ability for `.draw_line` to draw `curve` points.

### Changed
- Disaggregated "min_words_vertical" (default: 3) and "min_words_horizontal" (default: 1), removing "text_word_threshold".
- Internally, made `utils.decimalize` a bit more robust; now throws errors on non-decimalizable items.
- Now explicitly ignoring some (obscure) `pdfminer` object attributes.
- Raw input for `.draw_line` from a bounding box to `((x, y), (x, y))`, for consistency with `curve["points"]` and with `Pillow`'s underlying method.

### Fixed
- Fixed typo bug when `.rect_edges` is called before `.edges`

## [0.5.1] — 2017-02-26
### Added
- Quick-draw `PageImage` methods: `.draw_vline`, `.draw_vlines`, `.draw_hline`, and `.draw_hlines`.

### Changed
- Increased default `text_tolerance` and `intersection_tolerance` TableFinder values from 1 to 3.

### Fixed
- Properly handle conversion of PDFs with transparency to `pillow` images.
- Properly handle `pandas` DataFrames as inputs to multi-draw commands (e.g., `PageImage.draw_rects(...)`).

## [0.5.0] - 2017-02-25
### Added

- Disentangle `.crop` from `.intersects_bbox` and `.within_bbox`.
- Change default `x_tolerance` and `y_tolerance` for word extraction from `5` to `3`

## [0.4.6] - 2017-01-26
### Added
- Provide access to `Page.page_number`
